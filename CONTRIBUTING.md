# Contributing

You can contribute to the Albacore framework in many ways.

* Submit or comment on [issues][1] (add your vote to an issue by leaving a "+1" comment).
* Post questions or comment on discussions about development and usage on the [user group][2].
* Submit code changes via pull requests or comment on code reviews (details below).

## Overview

Start by [forking the repository][3]. Make your changes in the *dev* branch (or a feature branch, whichever you're most comfortable with). Make sure to add or edit tests, as necessary. Submit your pull request to the Albacore/albacore *dev* branch. You will be notified by Travis, our servant, whether your pull request passes all tests. When the code has been reviewed and merged, it will be included in the next gem.

Be sure to set your [line-endings][4] correctly for your platform, *before* you start developing.
