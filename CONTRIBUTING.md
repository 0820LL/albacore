# Contributing

You are very welcome to submit pull requests - preferrably to the *dev* branch, which is merged with master at release-time. You will be notified by Travis, our servant, whether your pull request passes all tests (and your *newly written* tests, too), in your pull request discussion area. When the code has been vetted and merged, it will be included in the next gem build.
